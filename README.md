## Testing and Revising

Since part 3 of the assignment I have added a further three variable parameters to the face.  I have added parameters for earrings, lip vibrancy and facial hair length.  I did this to enhance the amount of possible variations.  The earrings and facial hair length properties provide an extra level of uniqueness as these features are not always present.  

Once I had training data for all of the faces I did a lot of testing and made further adjustments to the training data based on the results.  I think my faces work quite well in both testing modes but I found it does take a bit of practice to consistently get the answer correct.
