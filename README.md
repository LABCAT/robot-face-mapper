## Training Examples

For the training examples part of this assignment I have chosen to map 5 properties of the faces.  The features I have chosen are eyebrow thickness, smile size, eye brightness, hair length and skin tone. 

I think my choice of properties to map does a good job of providing more variety in the resulting face and also makes the face look more unique for each individual.  

The two properties I am most pleased with are the smile size and hair length.  I have used the smile size property to determine how high and low the peaks for the "Audio Wave" smile can be which has a very interesting effect.  I used the hair length property to determine how many waves of static electricity the robot face has which also creates a very interesting effect. If the person has no hair then they get a dome instead.
