### Object Oriented Face

For the object oriented face I decided to port over the robot face I created in part 1 of the assignment.  I choose the robot face over the monster face because I think it will work well in regards to the overall goal of this assignment. 

In the portraits part of the last assignment I thought about drawing a robot version of myself. I tried a few tools online that convert portraits into robot faces for inspiration however I wasn't very happy with the results.  For this assignment I think I will work towards creating a similar tool that can provide better results.
