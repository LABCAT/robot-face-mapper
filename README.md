### Face Mappings

I found this part of the assignment quite challenging because at first I wasn't sure how I could transform the provided data into my robot face.  

As I delved into the code I started to understand the data better and this led me to various ideas of how I could use the data.  I have often used the data for other purposes than it was intended. For example, I have used eyebrow data to position the antennas and the nose data to position the neck.

The part of the face I am most satisfied with is the mouth which I created by merging the lip data and sorting it based on the x values. I used the results of this to draw the shape of the outer mouth and create an "audio wave" styled shape for the inner mouth. I think this has worked very well to make the face look robotic.
